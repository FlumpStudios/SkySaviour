# Sky Saviour

Sky Saviour is an original shump for the Commodore 64 written in in 6502 assembly.

## How to play

Defend the futuristic city of NeoCov from bizarre alien insect invaders! Your mission is to intercept and eliminate the enemies before they reach the city center.

Use the fire button to shoot down the alien threats, but there's a catch, you can only carry 7 shells at a time. To reload, descend into NeoCov city center. Drop down into NeoCov city centre to reload, beware however, whilst in the city you are unable to shoot.

Your ship is invulnerable to enemy collisions, but be wary of their bullets. A direct hit to your ship's hit point will cost you a life.

## Scoring
The amount of shells you have represent the amount of points that will add to you chain, 7 shells adds 7 points.

## Chains
Shooting enemies without missing adds 10 points to your chain. Dropping into the city banks your chain, turning your accumulated points into your score. For a perfect scoring run, destroy 7 enemies in a row without missing, then drop into the city to bank your chain. The challenge intensifies as the enemies become more numerous and aggressive!

## Bonus life
You will recieve a bonus live when you hit 1000 points

## Tip
Don't forget to reload between waves


Note: This uses joystick port 1.
